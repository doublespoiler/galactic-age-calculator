# Galactic Space Calculator

#### By Skylan Lew

#### Epidocuds Project 5 Test-Driven Development and Environments with JavaScript

## Technologies Used

* JS
* Node
* npm
* babel
* ESLint
* Jest
* Webpack

## Description

This project was to demonstrate knowledge of Jest testing. As a result, it has no UI. The user can input their birth month, birth day, birth year, and the current date (in a GUI application, this would be fetched by the application). The program stores their birthday and the current date.

The program then has a few functions designed to be run after initial user input. `planetCalc()` calculates the user's age on each planet in years. the `___Diff()` functions calculate the difference between the user's age on earth, and the converted life expectancy on each planet, and returns the difference in age (negative if younger, positive if older). This corresponds with their life expectancy on each planet, and how many years they have lived past their life expectancy, respectively.
